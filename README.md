# json-parser
A simple json parser program assignment i got at a job interview.

Run the program with ``python program.py`` and specify the (relative or absolute) path to the json file you want to parse. 

You can also pass the file path as a command line argument, for example: ``python program.py ./data_task2_1.json``

Result will be saved in ``output.txt``.
